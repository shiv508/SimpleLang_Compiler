# SimpleLang_Compiler
1. The Compilier successfully generates correct assembly code from input.txt source code.
2. All components including lexer, parser, symbol table, and code generator are working as expected.
3. The final step (simulation using Verlog) could not be performed due to system/terminal issues.
4. I try my best to complete the integrating the task.
